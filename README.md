hungman

It involves a person choosing a word and specifying the number of letters, and the second player guessing the letters to make the word. You have a specific number of wrong letters that you will choose.

All letters will appear to you. If the letter is correct, it will be placed in its correct place in the word; if it is wrong, part of the gallows will be drawn. 

The game will end when the man is hanged (it's the name of the game)
